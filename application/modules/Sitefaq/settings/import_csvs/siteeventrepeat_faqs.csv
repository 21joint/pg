I am not able to edit the start date of my event. What might be the reason?|<p>If your event is a recurring event with guests in it, then you will not be able to edit your start date. But you can choose to extend the event’s duration by increasing the End Date. You can only edit the start date of your recurring event until no guests have joined it.</p>|Events|Recurring Events
Some guests have joined my event, but now I am not able to see them anymore in the Guests tab on my Event Profile. What might be the reason?|<p>You might not be able to see guests in the Guests tab, as you may have edited the occurrences of your event. When you edit the occurrences of your event, then new occurrences are created and guests associated with the previous occurrences automatically leave them. You will see guests in your event after members join new occurrences of your event.</p>|Events|Recurring Events
