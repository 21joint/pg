It is most likely that in this case, the reviewer might edit their review and rating themselves. If that does not yield results, then you may report the review to our site administrators by clicking on the &ldquo;Report&rdquo; link on the main review business, and filling the appropriate values. Our site administrators will then take appropriate action on the review.</p>|Business Solutions|Reviews and Ratings
