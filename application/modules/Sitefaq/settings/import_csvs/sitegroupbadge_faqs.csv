What is a group Badge? How can a Badge assigned to my group be useful for it?|<p>Assigning of a Badge to your group can enhance the identity of your group. The associated badge is displayed on your group in an attractive manner along with its title and description. As Badges are used to specifically mark groupes on this community, they can also be used to help users in better identifying the type of groupes they are looking for. From the search form for groupes, users can easily do a quick filtering to see groupes belonging to a particular Badge.</p>|Group Solutions|Badge
