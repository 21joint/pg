Someone has written an inaccurate review for my Page. What should I do?|<p>If someone has written an inaccurate or unfavourable review for your Page, then we recommend you to first communicate with the reviewer yourself, and ask clarification for the review. You may explain to the reviewer the actual situation, and why you feel that their review is inappropriate. It is most likely that in this case, the reviewer might edit their review and rating themselves. If that does not yield results, then you may report the review to our site administrators by clicking on the &ldquo;Report&rdquo; link on the main review page, and filling the appropriate values. Our site administrators will then take appropriate action on the review.</p>|Page and Business Solutions|Reviews and Ratings
