STYLE GUIDES
Guidance Guide is a forum for your thoughtful reviews, photos, videos, tips and more. Thus, we've put together these general guidelines for keeping it clean and classy here on our site:
Guidance Guide  REVIEW SECTION
Go Bare: That’s right, bare it all. The best reviews are personal and passionate as well as open and honest. Writing a review of something you received from us? Make sure to disclose that you received the products free from Influenster for testing purposes.

Use Good Taste: We at Guidance Guide pride ourselves on our style, so don’t trash your reputation by using offensive language and imagery. Furthermore, threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry will not be tolerated. Stay in Good Form: Let’s save the non sequiturs for the blogosphere. We expect your contributions to be relevant to the product you’re reviewing. Reviews aren't the place for rants about political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.

Cut Out the Bias: Your contributions should be objective. Don’t review your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' businesses, or businesses in your networking group.

Say It, Don’t Sell It: Guidance Guide is the power of YOU. Here, consumers have the final word, so let’s not muck up our review section with more commercial noise.

Keep Secrets: Remember the Golden Rule? Please respect the privacy of others. This means refraining from publishing personal information, close-up photos, and full names of any of your friends, enemies, and countrymen.

Innovation, Not Imitation: What you learned in middle school still applies - absolutely NO plagiarism. We want to hear from you, so show us your (own) stuff!

Avoid the Overstatement: It’s easy to get carried away. Please avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting your experience.

Be Picky - Click Hearts with Discretion: These hearts don’t mean whether you “Agree.” Like reviews only when they’re useful, helpful, and truthful. Reviews are sorted by what's most helpful, so make sure new visitors see the ones that shine.

Be Constructive: We all know how disappointing it can be when you buy something only to find it doesn’t work the way you thought it would. While it may be tempting to vent your frustrations here, remember that reviews should relay “what” and “why.” And please, for everyone’s sake, lay off the caps lock.

Be Creative: These reviews weren’t written by robots. Let the “you” shine through!
Have Questions?

Be Curious: Guidance Guide users have the answers. If you want to know more about a product, use the platform. But first, check that your question hasn’t already been asked. It probably has!

Share the Wealth: Think you’ve got the answer? Help out your fellow Guidance Guide BA’s with all the info you’ve got. Your answers should be helpful, honest, and relevant. Spread the knowledge!
*Please be advised that Guidance Guide retains the right to remove any inappropriate content or to revoke membership for Style Guide violations.

STYLE GUIDES
Guidance Guide is a forum for your thoughtful reviews, photos, videos, tips and more. Thus, we've put together these general guidelines for keeping it clean and classy here on our site:
Guidance Guide  REVIEW SECTION
Go Bare: That’s right, bare it all. The best reviews are personal and passionate as well as open and honest. Writing a review of something you received from us? Make sure to disclose that you received the products free from Influenster for testing purposes.

Use Good Taste: We at Guidance Guide pride ourselves on our style, so don’t trash your reputation by using offensive language and imagery. Furthermore, threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry will not be tolerated. Stay in Good Form: Let’s save the non sequiturs for the blogosphere. We expect your contributions to be relevant to the product you’re reviewing. Reviews aren't the place for rants about political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.

Cut Out the Bias: Your contributions should be objective. Don’t review your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' businesses, or businesses in your networking group.

Say It, Don’t Sell It: Guidance Guide is the power of YOU. Here, consumers have the final word, so let’s not muck up our review section with more commercial noise.

Keep Secrets: Remember the Golden Rule? Please respect the privacy of others. This means refraining from publishing personal information, close-up photos, and full names of any of your friends, enemies, and countrymen.

Innovation, Not Imitation: What you learned in middle school still applies - absolutely NO plagiarism. We want to hear from you, so show us your (own) stuff!

Avoid the Overstatement: It’s easy to get carried away. Please avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting your experience.

Be Picky - Click Hearts with Discretion: These hearts don’t mean whether you “Agree.” Like reviews only when they’re useful, helpful, and truthful. Reviews are sorted by what's most helpful, so make sure new visitors see the ones that shine.

Be Constructive: We all know how disappointing it can be when you buy something only to find it doesn’t work the way you thought it would. While it may be tempting to vent your frustrations here, remember that reviews should relay “what” and “why.” And please, for everyone’s sake, lay off the caps lock.

Be Creative: These reviews weren’t written by robots. Let the “you” shine through!
Have Questions?

Be Curious: Guidance Guide users have the answers. If you want to know more about a product, use the platform. But first, check that your question hasn’t already been asked. It probably has!

Share the Wealth: Think you’ve got the answer? Help out your fellow Guidance Guide BA’s with all the info you’ve got. Your answers should be helpful, honest, and relevant. Spread the knowledge!
*Please be advised that Guidance Guide retains the right to remove any inappropriate content or to revoke membership for Style Guide violations.

STYLE GUIDES
Guidance Guide is a forum for your thoughtful reviews, photos, videos, tips and more. Thus, we've put together these general guidelines for keeping it clean and classy here on our site:
Guidance Guide  REVIEW SECTION
Go Bare: That’s right, bare it all. The best reviews are personal and passionate as well as open and honest. Writing a review of something you received from us? Make sure to disclose that you received the products free from Guidande Guide for testing purposes.

Use Good Taste: We at Guidance Guide pride ourselves on our style, so don’t trash your reputation by using offensive language and imagery. Furthermore, threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry will not be tolerated. Stay in Good Form: Let’s save the non sequiturs for the blogosphere. We expect your contributions to be relevant to the product you’re reviewing. Reviews aren't the place for rants about political ideologies, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the core of the consumer experience.

Cut Out the Bias: Your contributions should be objective. Don’t review your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' businesses, or businesses in your networking group.

Say It, Don’t Sell It: Guidance Guide is the power of YOU. Here, consumers have the final word, so let’s not muck up our review section with more commercial noise.

Keep Secrets: Remember the Golden Rule? Please respect the privacy of others. This means refraining from publishing personal information, close-up photos, and full names of any of your friends, enemies, and countrymen.

Innovation, Not Imitation: What you learned in middle school still applies - absolutely NO plagiarism. We want to hear from you, so show us your (own) stuff!

Avoid the Overstatement: It’s easy to get carried away. Please avoid exaggerating or misrepresenting your experience.

Be Picky - Click Hearts with Discretion: These hearts don’t mean whether you “Agree.” Like reviews only when they’re useful, helpful, and truthful. Reviews are sorted by what's most helpful, so make sure new visitors see the ones that shine.

Be Constructive: We all know how disappointing it can be when you buy something only to find it doesn’t work the way you thought it would. While it may be tempting to vent your frustrations here, remember that reviews should relay “what” and “why.” And please, for everyone’s sake, lay off the caps lock.

Be Creative: These reviews weren’t written by robots. Let the “you” shine through!
Have Questions?

Be Curious: Guidance Guide users have the answers. If you want to know more about a product, use the platform. But first, check that your question hasn’t already been asked. It probably has!

Share the Wealth: Think you’ve got the answer? Help out your fellow Guidance Guide BA’s with all the info you’ve got. Your answers should be helpful, honest, and relevant. Spread the knowledge!
*Please be advised that Guidance Guide retains the right to remove any inappropriate content or to revoke membership for Style Guide violations.
