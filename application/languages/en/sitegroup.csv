have allowed Group Owners to be able to arrange, add and remove widgets from the
profile of their Groups. However, you still have control over what Group Profile
widgets should be available to Group Owners, which widgets they should NOT be
able to remove, and which ones they should be able to remove. If you have added
a new plugin on your site, and would like its widget to be shown on Group
Profiles and NOT be removable by Group Owners, then you can drop that widget into
Group Profile below. If you would like to show an announcement, or any HTML
content on Group Profiles, and NOT allow Group Owners to be able to remove it,
then you can do that as well below. If there is a widget coming on profiles of
Groups of your site that you want to be removed, then you can do that below; and
many more such actions.
If you drop a widget from a different plugin into the Group Profile, then Group
Owners will NOT be able to remove it or drag-n-drop it. If you ""lock"" a Group
Profile widget that has NOT been placed in the Group Profile Placement area, then
that widget will NOT be available to Group Owners for placing on the Group. If you
""lock"" a Group Profile widget that has been placed in the Group Profile
Placement area, then Group Owners will NOT be able to remove it or drag-n-drop
it.<br />NOTE: If you have placed ""Ad Campaign"" or ""Html Block"" on this group, then
once you click on the ""Save Changes"" link, you will neither be able to change
the position nor edit that block. So, if you want to do so, you will have to
remove that block from the Group and save changes and then place it again from
the Available Blocks."
